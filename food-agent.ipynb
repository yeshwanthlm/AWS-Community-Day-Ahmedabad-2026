    "## AgentCore Identity & Agent Core Policy\n",
    "\n",
    "While the memory system enables the agent to remember user preferences over time, **AgentCore Identity** and **Agent Core Policy** work together to ensure that the agent operates securely and only has access to authorized tools and functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How Identity and Policy Work Together\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **AgentCore Identity (Authentication):**\n",
    "   - AgentCore Identity provides a secure way for agents to authenticate and obtain credentials for accessing external systems, APIs, or AWS resources.\n",
    "   - Using the `@requires_access_token` or `@requires_iam_access_token` decorators, agents can dynamically fetch short-lived OAuth 2.0 or AWS IAM tokens right before executing a tool.\n",
    "   - This prevents secrets from being hardcoded in the code and delegates the complex identity federation logic to AWS STS and Identity Providers.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Agent Core Policy (Authorization & Governance):**\n",
    "   - Once an agent is authenticated and attempts to call a tool or API, **Agent Core Policy** intercepts the request at the *Bedrock Gateway* level (infrastructure layer).\n",
    "   - Policies (written in Cedar or Natural Language) evaluate the agent's identity, the specific tool being requested, and the context of the action.\n",
    "   - For example, an Agent Core Policy might state: *\"Only the 'FoodieBuddy' agent identity is allowed to access the `book_restaurant` tool, and only if the reservation cost is under $100.\"*\n",
    "   - If the policy denies the action, the Gateway blocks the request deterministically, completely independently of the agent's LLM code.\n",
    "\n",
    "By combining Identity (who the agent is and how it authenticates) and Policy (what the agent's identity is strictly allowed to do), developers can build secure, enterprise-ready agents.\n",
    "\n",
    "Below is an example simulating how a mock tool might request a Machine-to-Machine (M2M) IAM access token via Identity before making a request. (Note: A real-world scenario would require setting up outbound OAuth/JWT federation in your AWS account)."
